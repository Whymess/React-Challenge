Application is separated into views and components.
Sorting methods are given their own ulti folder for clarity reasons and future updates to the sorting algorithm.
Application view is the parent view and retains the main logic of the entire application.
I used bootstrap and create react app. No external state management is needed.
Setup: git clone, npm install, npm run start
